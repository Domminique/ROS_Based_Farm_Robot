### orthogonal rectification of images
- using webODM for image rectification

- one of the two methods that can be used are:
	- ground control points (GCP) which are determined from published maps or global positioning systems (GPS).
	- digital elevation model (DEM) which are 3d representation of a terrain.

### better way for rectification and stitching
We are using the SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) and SURF (Speeded-Up Ro-bust Features) algorithms to simultaneously ortho-rectify the images and also stitch them.
